# Online-Quiz-Grading-System-using-C++
Project Overview
The Online Quiz & Grading System is a C++-based program designed to manage quizzes and student scores efficiently. It allows users to select from four quizzes on a specific subject (e.g., MT-103) and choose the best answer. At the end of the quiz, the system calculates and displays the final score. Additionally, users can input, modify, and delete quiz scores, making it a simple yet effective grading system.

Features
Quiz Selection – Users can choose from four different quizzes and answer questions.
Score Calculation – The system automatically evaluates responses and displays the final score.
Student Record Management – Users can add, update, view, and delete student quiz records.
File Handling – The program saves student records in a file, ensuring data persistence.

Technical Details
Programming Language: C++
Core Concepts Used: File handling, conditional statements, functions, and user input validation.
Functions Implemented:

readRecord(): Displays stored quiz records.
updateRecord(): Allows users to modify quiz scores.
deleteRecord(): Removes a student's record from the system.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical use of C++ for data management. The system efficiently handles quiz grading, allowing students to track their progress. Changes made to records are stored in a file, ensuring that all modifications are saved for future reference.
